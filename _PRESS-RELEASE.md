There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features./

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##

  wishList


## Sub-Heading ##

  Helping smart shoppers and bargain seekers make informed decisions about whether to buy a product now or save it for later.

## Summary ##

  Our application collects price data from multiple vendors to give users a clear idea of the average cost of a product they're interested in purchasing. Based on the cost of an item, users can decide whether to purchase the item or add it to a wish list. They can set a price point on items on their list and receive alerts if a vendor's price for the item matches that price point. Users can also access the price history for an item, giving them an idea of how that item's price may change in the future.

## Problem ##

  When shopping online, consumers often don't have a way of aggregating all their desired products into a single list.

## Solution ##

  Our app offers an interactive wish list where users can view all their current must-have products.  We provide the additional convenience of price comparison across common vendors to assist users in deciding when to buy a product.

## Quote from You ##

  We're here to provide customers an organized, informed, stress-free online shopping experience.



## How to Get Started ##

  Search for what you want.  If you want to buy it, simply click through to buy it from a vendor's main page.  If you want to save it for later, add it to your wish list with a click of a button.  You can even set a desired price point for an item and recieve notifications when the item's price drops.

## Customer Quote ##

  "Whenever the holidays come around, I get so stressed trying to keep all my gifts straight.  WishList helped me keep track of what to buy - and when!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
